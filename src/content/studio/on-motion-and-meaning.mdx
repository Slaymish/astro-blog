## On Motion and Meaning

I like interfaces that show their working. If something appears, I want to see where it came from.<MarginNote>Early web pages overdid it with moving parts, but stillness is not the answer either.</MarginNote>  
Used well, motion makes <DefinitionPopover term="structure" subtitle="Relations, not just boxes">
  How parts relate inside the whole, not just where they sit.
</DefinitionPopover> visible.

<PullQuote align="center" size="large">
I use motion to show what changed and why.
</PullQuote>

If a panel slides in from the left, I know it lived off screen on the left. If it just fades in, I only know it exists.<Footnote number={1}>A slide hints at origin and direction. A fade only says “now it is here”.</Footnote>

<ClaimCounter leftLabel="Cause" rightLabel="Effect">
  <div slot="left">
    Movement points to an origin. A slide reads like a because.
  </div>
  <div slot="right">
    The revealed bit reads like the therefore. The link is easier to see.
  </div>
</ClaimCounter>

Attention follows movement.<MarginNote>That is biology. Moving things once meant food or danger.</MarginNote>  
One clear shift will guide the eye better than an arrow stacked with labels.

When a value updates, I show how it moved, not just that it flickered to a new number.<Footnote number={2}>Transitions bridge states so I do not have to remember the old one from scratch.</Footnote>

<PullQuote align="left">
Animation is punctuation. Use it to make the sentence legible.
</PullQuote>

## Practice

Here is how this page works in plain terms.  
Margin notes hold side thoughts.  
Footnotes open in place.  
Key terms open where you are, then get out of the way.

<DialecticTabs>
  <div slot="thesis">
    Motion can clarify structure. It maps change onto space and time so the point lands.
  </div>
  <div slot="antithesis">
    Motion can also muddy it. Too slow or too fancy and the idea gets lost.
  </div>
  <div slot="synthesis">
    I keep motion proportionate to the idea. It should expose the relation, not perform for it.
  </div>
</DialecticTabs>

Motion is not decoration.  
It clarifies, directs, and connects. That is enough.

*This page is a demo of the Studio pieces: margin notes, footnotes, pull quotes, tabs, and counters. They are here to show how meaning moves, not to be clever about it.*

## On Motion and Meaning

Most interfaces are still. Text appears instantly; things simply *are* without ever *becoming*.<MarginNote>Early web pages were the opposite—too much movement, too little meaning.</MarginNote>  
Motion, when used well, restores cause and effect. It makes structure visible.

<PullQuote align="center" size="large">
Motion is thought made visible.
</PullQuote>

When a panel slides in from the left, its origin is clear. When it fades in, the relation is lost.<Footnote number={1}>A fade communicates appearance, not connection. It hides spatial context.</Footnote>

<InteractiveBlock type="bordered" caption="Sliding motion shows relation">
  <RevealOnScroll effect="slide-left" distance="32px">
    <SlidingPanelDemo label="Replay slide" />
  </RevealOnScroll>
  <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem', color: 'var(--studio-text-muted)', fontFamily: 'var(--studio-font-sans)', fontSize: 'var(--studio-text-xs)', textAlign: 'center' }}>
    Click the button to replay the motion.
  </p>
</InteractiveBlock>

Attention follows movement.<MarginNote>Evolution hard-wired this; moving things meant food or threat.</MarginNote>  
A single shift on screen can guide the eye more reliably than any arrow.

When a value updates, show *how* it changed, not only *that* it did.<Footnote number={2}>Transitions bridge states. Without them, understanding relies on memory.</Footnote>

<PullQuote align="left">
Animation is punctuation. Use it to make structure legible.
</PullQuote>

## Practice

Each Studio essay applies these principles.  
Margin notes hold side thoughts.  
Footnotes open inline.  
Interactive blocks illustrate ideas only when words fall short.

<InteractiveBlock type="centered" caption="Concepts unfold through interaction">
  <RevealOnScroll effect="rise" distance="24px">
    <div style="padding: 3rem; text-align: center; color: var(--studio-text-primary);">
      ◆
    </div>
  </RevealOnScroll>
</InteractiveBlock>

Motion is never decoration.  
It clarifies, directs, and connects—nothing more.

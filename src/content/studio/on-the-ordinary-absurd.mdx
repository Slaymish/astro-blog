## On the Ordinary Absurd

It isn't some grand comic property, just a by-product of our ability to reason. More like scraping your knees after falling off a bike than watching the heat death of the universe. 
It's laughable, genuinely. 
*Of course* it exists somewhere: infinity breeds infinite contradictions. As a reasoning animal, you feel it. 
Breathe. The gift of an indifferent universe is permission. 
Nothing forbids you. 
Do what you will, and laugh at how perfectly <DefinitionPopover term="absurd" subtitle="The conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe."></DefinitionPopover> it all is.

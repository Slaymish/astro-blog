## On the Ordinary Absurd

It isn’t some grand cosmic joke, just a by-product of our ability to reason. More like scraping your knees after falling off a bike than watching the heat death of the universe. It’s laughable, genuinely. *Of course* it exists somewhere: infinity breeds contradictions. As a reasoning animal, you feel it.

Breathe. The gift of an indifferent universe is permission. Nothing forbids you. Do what you will, and laugh at how perfectly <DefinitionPopover subtitle="The clash between our search for meaning and the world’s refusal to supply it.">absurd</DefinitionPopover> it all is.

## On UX in writing
  
I like interfaces that make use of their medium. Digital writing can reveal relationships and context in ways static text never could.<MarginNote side="right">An example that comes to mind is when reading on a kindle, you can tap a word to see its definition without losing your place in the text.</MarginNote>

If iâ€™m writing on a screen, I want to use what the screen can do.

### Practice

So I created a few components to make writing clearer and more engaging.

- Margin notes hold side thoughts.
- Footnotes expand in place.
- Quote blocks draw attention to key ideas.
- Tabs invite exploration of different sides of a discussion.
- Audio players set mood and tone.

    Digital writing should leverage interactive components to enhance understanding and engagement.

    However, too much interactivity can be distracting and detract from the main message.

    The key is to let interactivity support the content, not compete with it.
